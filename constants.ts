    domain: "Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development",
    description: "Background: In dairy farming, evaluating the body structure of animals is vital to predict their longevity, productivity, and reproductive efficiency. Traditionally, Animal Type Classification (ATC)—which involves scoring animals for physical traits—is conducted by trained personnel through visual inspection and manual measurement of specific body parts. However, this manual method is prone to human error and subjectivity, even with trained professionals, resulting in inconsistent and potentially unreliable data.\n\nWith advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image processing technologies, there is an opportunity to automate this process. Automated scoring based on images can ensure standardization, minimize observer bias, and improve the reliability of data captured for scientific and breeding purposes.\n\nDescription: The Government of India is implementing the Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) since December 2014, aiming to conserve and develop indigenous bovine breeds, genetically upgrade the bovine population, and enhance milk productivity. Under this mission, Progeny Testing (PT) and Pedigree Selection (PS) programs are being carried out in key dairy breeds across the country to produce high genetic merit bulls for breeding purposes.\n\nAnimal Type Classification (ATC) is a crucial step in identifying top-performing elite dams, which are potential mothers of future breeding bulls. Currently, ATC is performed manually by a trained Animal Typer who visually examines and measures physical traits, and then records the scores in the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA). Despite training, errors due to fatigue, bias, or measurement inaccuracies can adversely affect data quality and scientific analysis.\n\nThere is a need for an AI-driven solution that can automate this classification process by analyzing animal images, extracting body structure parameters, and assigning standardized scores with minimal human intervention. If integrated with BPA, such a solution would enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scientific validity of animal evaluation under PT and PS programs.\n\nExpected Solution: Students are expected to develop an AI-based Auto Recording of Animal Type Classification System that can:\n\nUse images of cattle and buffaloes to evaluate physical traits relevant to Animal Type Classification.\nExtract and quantify specific body structure parameters (e.g., body length, height at withers, chest width, rump angle, etc.) using AI and image processing techniques.\nGenerate objective and consistent classification scores.\nAuto-record and store the classification data in a structured format.\nProvide seamless integration with BPA to auto-save the classification records at the time of evaluation.\nBe user-friendly and operable by field personnel with minimal technical skills."

    description: "Background\n\nIn Ayurveda and other traditional medicine systems, Rasa (taste) is a fundamental criterion for identifying, classifying, and determining the therapeutic value of medicinal herbs. While this taste-based assessment has been effective for centuries, it is inherently subjective, relying on human perception and expert experience, which often leads to variability and inconsistency.\n\nIn the modern context, ensuring the authenticity, quality, and standardization of herbal raw materials is a critical challenge due to widespread adulteration, batch-to-batch phytochemical variations, and the global demand for reliable herbal products.\n\nRecent advances in sensor science and analytical technologies provide innovative solutions to these challenges. Electronic tongue (e-tongue) systems can mimic human gustatory mechanisms by detecting complex chemical signatures, while spectroscopic techniques such as Near-Infrared (NIR), Raman, and UV-Visible spectroscopy offer rapid, non-destructive chemical profiling of herbal samples.\n\nWhen integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)—such as chemometric modelling, neural networks, and pattern recognition—large datasets can be analyzed to classify herbs based on taste profiles, threshold levels, and phytochemical composition with high precision. This AI-enabled, sensor-integrated approach ensures faster, objective, and cost-effective quality assurance, bridging traditional Ayurvedic principles with modern scientific validation.\n\nDetailed Description\n\nThe problem statement aims to design and develop a sensor-integrated AI-enabled device for objective quality assessment of marketed herbal samples. The device will incorporate:\n\n- A multi-sensor e-tongue array to detect basic taste modalities (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, astringent).\n- A threshold detection module for quantifying the minimum perceptible concentration of each taste-related compound.\n- Analytical integration with phytochemical profiling techniques (e.g., HPTLC, FTIR, LC-MS) for correlating taste signatures with chemical constituents.\n\nExpected Solution\n\n- A portable hardware prototype incorporating an electronic tongue (e-tongue) sensor array.\n- Calibration using authenticated herb samples and machine learning models trained on large datasets of taste and phytochemical fingerprints.\n- Smart alerts and decision support for detecting adulteration or substandard quality.\n- A centralized or cloud-compatible database that updates continuously with new samples and learning outputs.\n- Applicability across industries including Ayurvedic pharmacopeia standardization, herbal industry quality control, academic research, and regulatory bodies."

    description: "Background\nIndia’s Ayush sector is rapidly transitioning from paper-based records to interoperable digital health systems. Central to this transformation are two key coding systems: the National AYUSH Morbidity & Standardized Terminologies Electronic (NAMASTE) codes, which provide over 4,500 standardized terms for Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani disorders, WHO Standardised International Terminologies for Ayurveda and the WHO’s ICD-11, Chapter – 26, Traditional Medicine Module 2 (TM2), which integrates 529 disorder categories and 196 pattern codes into the global ICD framework. Harmonising these vocabularies within Electronic Medical Record (EMR) platforms not only enables accurate clinical documentation and decision support but also ensures compliance with India’s 2016 EHR Standards—mandating FHIR R4 APIs, SNOMED CT and LOINC semantics, ISO 22600 access control, ABHA-linked OAuth 2.0 authentication, and robust audit trails for consent and versioning.\n\nTo operationalize this dual-coding approach, EMR vendors must implement a lightweight terminology micro-service that ingests NAMASTE CSV and synchronises with the WHO-11 ICD-API (Including Biomedicine and TM2). Within the EMR user interface, diagnosis entries should support auto-complete widgets that return both NAMASTE and ICD-11 (TM2 and Biomedicine) codes, comply with the Coding rules of ICD-11 framework and store them together in the patient’s Problem List resource.

    organization: "Ministry of Ayush",
    category: "Software",
    description: "Background\nThe Ayurvedic herbal supply chain in India is characterised by fragmented networks of smallholder farmers, wild collectors and multiple intermediaries, leading to challenges in ensuring consistent quality, authenticity and sustainable sourcing of medicinal plants. Variations in harvesting practices, environmental conditions and manual record-keeping introduce risks of mislabeling, adulteration and over-harvesting of vulnerable species, undermining consumer trust and compliance with regulatory standards. Geographic provenance is often undocumented or opaque, making it difficult for manufacturers and regulators to verify that herbs originate from approved regions or follow sustainable collection guidelines.\n\nA blockchain-based traceability system, augmented with geo-tagging technology, can address these gaps by creating an immutable, decentralised ledger that records every step of the herb's journey—from on-site GPS-tagged collection events through processing, testing and formulation. Smart contracts on a permissioned network (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) can enforce sustainability criteria and automate quality validations, while IoT-enabled devices capture real-time location and environmental data at remote collection points, even via SMS-over-blockchain gateways where connectivity is sparse. By integrating FHIR-style metadata bundles (e.g., \"CollectionEvent,\" \"QualityTest,\" \"ProcessingStep\") and QR-code scanning at aggregation nodes, stakeholders gain end-to-end visibility, enabling rapid verification of provenance, streamlined certification for export and robust audit trails to support both biodiversity conservation and supply-chain efficiency. When herbs are formulated into finished products, unique, serialised QR codes generated by the blockchain platform could be affixed to each package. End customers scan these codes with a mobile app or web portal—powered by the same blockchain ledger—to retrieve a FHIR-style provenance bundle detailing each upstream event: farm of origin, harvest conditions, intermediary custody, laboratory certificates and batch formulation parameters. This consumer-facing transparency not only verifies authenticity and builds trust, but also supports ethical marketing, enables rapid recall management and fosters incentives for sustainable collection practices by linking premium pricing to verified harvest data. Over time, analytics on consumer scans can feed back into demand forecasting, closing the loop between consumer assurance and supply-chain optimisation.\n\nDescription\n\nA permissioned blockchain network will immutably record every stage of an Ayurvedic herb's journey—from geo-tagged harvest events by farmers or wild collectors, through multi-stage processing and laboratory testing, to the finished product on retail shelves. At the point of collection, GPS-enabled mobile or IoT devices capture precise location, timestamp, collector identity, species identification and initial quality metrics as a \"Collection Event.\" Subsequent \"Processing Step\" and \"Quality Test\" events—each embedding standardised metadata bundles—are added by processing facilities and testing laboratories. Smart contracts enforce National Medicinal Plants Board sustainability guidelines and Good Agricultural and Collection Practices by automatically validating geo-fencing rules, seasonal restrictions and quality thresholds before committing each transaction to the ledger.\n\nWhen formulation is complete, unique QR codes generated on-chain are affixed to product packaging. End customers scan these codes via a lightweight web or mobile portal (no specialised app required) to retrieve the full provenance record: farm coordinates and harvest conditions; chain-of-custody handoffs; lab certificates for moisture, pesticide and DNA-barcode tests; and sustainability and fair-trade compliance proofs. This consumer-facing transparency assures authenticity and safety, enables rapid recall notifications for affected batches and tells the story of each product—complete with interactive maps and farmer or community profiles. By combining tamper-proof audit trails, geo-tagged traceability and automated compliance enforcement, the system delivers a replicable model for ethical, sustainable and trust-driven Ayurvedic herb sourcing.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nParticipants will deliver a proof-of-concept blockchain-based botanical traceability system addressing end-to-end provenance of Ayurvedic herbs. The solution should include the following core components and capabilities:\n\n1. Permissioned Blockchain Network\n    - A lightweight, permissioned ledger (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric or Corda) that records every supply-chain transaction.\n    - Network nodes representing farmers' cooperatives, wild-collector groups, testing laboratories, processing facilities and manufacturers.\n    - Smart contracts enforcing:\n    - Geo-fencing rules based on collectors' GPS coordinates and approved harvesting zones.\n    - Seasonal-harvest restrictions and species-specific conservation limits per National Medicinal Plants Board guidelines.\n    - Quality-gate validations (e.g., moisture thresholds, pesticide limits, DNA barcoding checks).\n\n2. Geo-Tagged Data Capture\n    - IoT/GPS-enabled mobile DApp (or SMS-over-blockchain gateway) for collectors to record \"CollectionEvent\" metadata: latitude/longitude, timestamp, collector ID, species and initial quality metrics.\n    - Sensor integrations or manual interfaces for \"QualityTest\" events (lab results) and \"ProcessingStep\" events (drying, grinding, storage conditions).\n\n3. Smart Labeling & Consumer Portal\n    - On-chain generation of unique QR codes for each finished product batch.\n    - A lightweight web/mobile portal (no specialised install required) allowing end customers to scan QR codes and retrieve a complete FHIR-style provenance bundle:\n    - Collection location map and harvest details\n    - Chain-of-custody handoffs through each supply-chain node\n    - Laboratory certificates for moisture, pesticide analysis, DNA authentication\n    - Sustainability compliance proofs and fair-trade verifications\n    - Interactive farmer/community profiles and conservation credentials\n\n4. Integration & Interoperability\n    - RESTful APIs for supply-chain managers to query real-time dashboards of harvest volumes, batch statuses, QA results and sustainability metrics.\n    - Plugins or connectors to existing ERP/quality-management systems for seamless data exchange.\n    - Use of FHIR-style resource models (CollectionEvent, QualityTest, ProcessingStep, Provenance) for standardized metadata exchange.\n\n5. User Interfaces & Reporting\n    - A mobile DApp interface optimized for low-bandwidth rural environments, with offline data capture and SMS synchronization.\n    - A web dashboard for stakeholders to monitor network health, query provenance records and generate compliance reports aligned with AYUSH Ministry export and sustainability requirements.\n    - Automated reporting modules that compile environmental-impact metrics and conservation compliance data for certification bodies.\n\n6. Demonstration & Evaluation\n    - A live pilot using one botanical species (e.g., Ashwagandha) across a small farming cooperative and a collaborating processor.\n    - End-to-end demonstration: geo-tagging harvest, adding lab results, processing events, QR code scanning by simulated consumers and recall simulation.\n    - Metrics collection on data-capture latency, transaction throughput, offline sync reliability and consumer-scan engagement.\n\n\nBy delivering these elements, participants will showcase a replicable, transparent and sustainable model for botanical traceability that bridges traditional Ayurvedic sourcing with modern blockchain technology and consumer empowerment."

While citizens may encounter these issues daily, a lack of effective reporting and tracking mechanisms limits municipal responsiveness. A streamlined, mobile-first solution can bridge this gap by empowering community members to submit real-world reports that municipalities can systematically address.\n\nDetailed Description\n\nThe system revolves around an easy-to-use mobile interface that allows users to submit reports in real-time. Each report can contain a photo, automatic location tagging, and a short text or voice explanation, providing sufficient context. These submissions populate a centralized dashboard featuring a live, interactive map of the city's reported issues. The system highlights priority areas based on volume of submissions, urgency inferred from user inputs, or other configurable criteria.\n\nOn the administrative side, staff access a powerful dashboard where they can view, filter, and categorize incoming reports. Automated routing directs each report to the relevant department such as sanitation or public works based on the issue type and location. System architecture accommodates spikes in reporting, ensuring quick image uploads, responsive performance across devices, and near real-time updates on both mobile and desktop clients.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nThe final deliverable should include a mobile platform that supports cross-device functionality and seamless user experience. Citizens must be able to capture issues effortlessly, track the progress of their reports, and receive notifications through each stage — confirmation, acknowledgment, and resolution.\nOn the back end, a web-based administrative portal should enable municipal staff to filter issues by category, location, or priority, assign tasks, update statuses, and communicate progress. The platform should integrate an automated routing engine that leverages report metadata to correctly allocate tasks to departments.\nA scalable, resilient backend must manage high volumes of multimedia content, support concurrent users, and provide APIs for future integrations or extensions. Lastly, the solution should deliver analytics and reporting features that offer insights into reporting trends, departmental response times, and overall system effectiveness — ultimately driving better civic engagement and government accountability."

    description: "Background\n\n\n**Microplastics** — plastic particles less than 5 mm in size — have emerged as a global environmental threat, contaminating oceans, freshwater systems, and even drinking water. These particles originate from the degradation of larger plastics or from microbeads in consumer products. Their persistence and bioaccumulative nature pose serious risks to aquatic life, ecosystems, and potentially human health. Current methods for detecting microplastics — such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy — are often accurate but time-consuming, expensive, and laboratory-dependent, limiting their application for real-time, field-based monitoring.\n\nDescription\n\nThe project aims to develop a low-cost, efficient, and portable sensor capable of detecting microplastics in various water sources. The focus may be on using optical detection techniques — such as light scattering, fluorescence, or absorbance — combined with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition. The sensor may be designed to identify microplastic particles based on their optical signatures, size distribution, and possibly polymer type. Water samples shall pass through a detection chamber, where embedded sensors capture spectral or visual data. This information would be processed in real time, either on-device or via a connected application. The system should be tested using standard microplastic samples (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene) and validated against existing lab-based techniques.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nThe expected outcome is a compact, field-deployable sensor system that can detect and quantify microplastics in water samples within minutes. It should offer reasonable sensitivity (down to 10–100 μm), operate on battery or solar power, and require minimal sample preparation. Additionally, the solution may include a companion software interface for data logging, visualization, and analysis. This innovation should have strong potential for adoption in microplastic monitoring, supporting researchers, environmental agencies, and water quality managers in making faster, data-driven decisions for pollution control and mitigation."

The Marine Living Resources Programme supports ecosystem-based research and monitoring, aimed at sustainable utilisation of these resources through scientific surveys, environmental studies, and data-driven ecosystem modelling.\n\nBackground\n\nIndia, with its vast coastline and rich marine biodiversity, relies heavily on the health of its ocean ecosystems for food security, climate regulation, and economic development. The Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE), under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, plays a pivotal role in collecting, managing, and analysing a broad spectrum of marine data to support sustainable ocean resource management.\n\nDetailed description\n\nCMLRE's datasets are diverse, complex, and multidisciplinary, including physical, chemical, and biological oceanography; fish abundance, species diversity, life history traits, and ecomorphology; fish taxonomy and otolith morphology; molecular biology data, including environmental DNA (eDNA) for species detection and biodiversity assessments. These datasets exist across various formats (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured), and are stored in siloed systems, making cross-domain integration, real-time visualization, and advanced analytics nearly impossible. This creates a major bottleneck for marine scientists, conservationists, and policymakers who need to make data-driven decisions for ecosystem conservation and fisheries management.\n\nCMLRE seeks an AI-enabled, intelligent digital platform that can integrate heterogeneous and high-volume datasets from oceanography, taxonomy, morphology, and molecular biology into a single unified system. The platform should support automated data ingestion, standardisation, and metadata tagging using internationally accepted formats, enable cross-disciplinary correlation analysis to study how ocean parameters influence biodiversity, fish distribution, and ecosystem health, and incorporate interactive modules for otolith shape and morphometrics visualisation, taxonomic classification and species identification, and molecular and eDNA data storage/retrieval and species matching.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThis platform will serve as a national marine data backbone, empowering India's scientific community with a next-generation tool for holistic marine ecosystem assessment. It will improve the efficiency of marine biodiversity research, enhance real-time decision-making, and support blue economy initiatives by enabling sustainable fisheries and conservation planning through integrated data insights.\n\nExpected Deliverables\n\n• A robust, cloud-ready web platform prototype.\n• Scalable backend architecture with modular data ingestion pipelines.\n• Visualisation tools for oceanographic and biodiversity trends.\n• Integrated modules for managing taxonomy, otolith morphology, and eDNA data.\n• Well-documented APIs and user manuals for future adoption and scaling."

    description: "Background\n\nThe deep ocean, encompassing vast and remote ecosystems like abyssal plains, hydrothermal vents, and seamounts, harbors a significant portion of global biodiversity, much of which remains undiscovered due to its inaccessibility. Understanding deep-sea biodiversity is critical for elucidating ecological interactions (e.g., food webs, nutrient cycling), informing conservation strategies for vulnerable marine habitats, and identifying novel eukaryotic species with potential biotechnological or ecological significance.\n\nEnvironmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive tool for studying these ecosystems by capturing genetic traces of organisms from environmental samples, such as seawater or sediment, without the need for physical collection or disturbance of fragile habitats. By targeting marker genes like 18S rRNA or COI, eDNA enables the detection of diverse eukaryotic taxa, including protists, cnidarians, and rare metazoans, offering insights into species richness and community structure.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE) will undertake routine voyages to the deep sea and collect sediment and water samples from hotspot regions for biodiversity assessment and ecosystem monitoring. The water and sediment samples will be used to extract eDNA and will be subject to high-throughput sequencing.\n\nHowever, assigning raw eDNA sequencing reads to eukaryotic taxa or inferring their ecological roles presents significant challenges, primarily due to the poor representation of deep-sea organisms in reference databases like SILVA, PR2, or NCBI. These databases, built primarily from well-studied terrestrial or shallow-water species, lack comprehensive sequences for deep-sea eukaryotes, leading to misclassifications, unassigned reads, or underestimation of biodiversity.\n\nTraditional bioinformatic pipelines for eDNA analysis, such as those implemented in QIIME2, DADA2, or mothur, rely heavily on sequence alignment or mapping to these databases, which is inadequate for novel or divergent deep-sea taxa. This dependency limits the discovery of new species and hinders accurate biodiversity assessments, critical for conservation in rapidly changing deep-sea environments. The computational time required for processing eDNA data exacerbates these challenges, particularly given the limitations of database-dependent methods and the complexity of eDNA datasets.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nTo address the challenges of poor database representation and computational time in deep-sea eDNA analysis, we propose an AI-driven pipeline that uses deep learning and unsupervised learning to identify eukaryotic taxa and assess biodiversity directly from raw eDNA reads. The solution should be able to classify the sequences, annotate and estimate abundance. This solution minimizes reliance on reference databases, reduces computational time through optimized workflows, and enables the discovery of novel taxa and ecological insights in deep-sea ecosystems."

    description: "Background\n\nThe majority of the farmers in India store the onion in naturally ventilated storage structures. In such structures, onions are exposed to extreme temperatures and relative humidity, which reduces the shelf life of onions and high storage loss. Improved onion storage technology will help in ensuring the availability of onions between seasons and obviate seasonal volatility in prices. The solutions could be in the form of improved, but cost-effective, materials and design of storage structures to manage temperature and relative humidity.\n\nDescription\n\nOnion is a semi-perishable vegetable and is harvested during the rabi season, accounting for 65% of onion production, and hits the markets from April to May. The same crop must continue to meet the consumer demand till the month of October-November every year, before the kharif crop is harvested and brought to the market. It is therefore vital to store onions successfully in order to meet the regular supply. It is observed that nearly 30-40% of the crop is lost during storage due to various reasons in form of physiological weight loss, rotting, sprouting etc. In unexpected situations such as natural calamities, the losses even go beyond 50% creating heavy stress both on the demand and supply sides. The losses that occurred during storage are in terms of qualitative as well as in quantitative ways. Hence, it is imperative to take some crucial steps pertaining to onion storage with minimum losses to ensure an adequate supply to the market, thereby reducing the price fluctuations.\n\nVarious abiotic factors like temperature, relative humidity affect the health of onions; hence, their balance is essential to store the crop with minimum losses. Recent technological advancements (such as Design, Solar/Plasma/Irradiation energy, Nanotechnology, IoT including AI/ML) also offer an opportunity to provide infrastructure for onion storage and supply chain, besides value addition, even in rural India. Design innovations are pervading various sectors, including efficient onion storage at the farm level, rural as well as urban markets. Different process and product development advances will fetch better returns to farmers and competitive prices for consumers. More importantly, it will help in addressing the present as well as the impending challenges.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nExtension of shelf life with minimum loss."

These tests, including conductor resistance, insulation/sheath thickness, and flame retardance, are crucial for ensuring cable safety and quality.\n\nExisting Problem\n\nCurrently, cable sample preparation involves significant manual intervention. The cable sample is manually cut by the operator and then straightened manually. Subsequently, these straightened PVC/XLPE/HDPE cable samples are cut into slices using electrically/pneumatically operated machines. Further, the samples are shaped as dumbbells by a dumbbell cutting machine. These manual and semi-automated steps are time-consuming, prone to human error, and introduce inconsistencies that compromise the accuracy and repeatability of critical test results.\n\nDetailed Description\n\nThis project develops an automated machine designed to precisely cut insulation and outer sheaths from cables, preparing specimens that strictly adhere to the aforementioned IS standards. Key features include an Automated Cable Feeding and Clamping System utilizing motor-driven rollers and adjustable clamps for secure, straightened cable handling. The Cutting and Stripping Module employs precision blades with programmable depths for clean, circumferential cuts and linear stripping, fulfilling specific length requirements for various tests. An integrated diameter sensor will auto-adjust settings. A Control System (PLC/HMI) manages operations, allows test method selection, monitors status, and provides closed-loop feedback. Automated specimen ejection and waste management further streamline workflow. Robust safety features like enclosed areas and interlocks will protect operators.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nThe automated machine will eliminate human error, guaranteeing consistent and repeatable specimen quality while significantly reducing preparation time and costs. By ensuring strict adherence to IS standards, the solution will yield more reliable test results and simplify product certification. This advancement will markedly improve accuracy, efficiency, and safety in cable testing, supporting high-quality control in the cable manufacturing industry."

    domain: "Miscellaneous",
    organization: "Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution (MoCA,F&PD)",
    category: "Hardware",
    description: "Background:\nHallmarking is the accurate determination and official recording of the proportionate content of precious metal in the jewellery/artefacts or bullion/coins. The hallmarking of gold jewellery was started in year 2000 and has been made mandatory since 23 June 2021 and presently covers 361 districts.\n\nThe Indian Standard, IS 1417 2016 \"Gold and gold alloys, jewellery/artefacts-fineness and marking specification\" covers hallmarking of six grades of gold jewellery/gold artefacts viz. 14K, 18K, 20K, 22K, 23K and 24K carats. The Indian Standard, IS 1418: 2009 \"Determination of gold in gold bullion, gold alloys and gold jewellery/artefacts - Cupellation (Fire Assay) method\" prescribes the fire assay test method for determining the fineness of gold in gold bullion, alloys, and jewellery/artefacts.\n\nThe fire assay testing method, though globally accepted and accurate, involves a destructive testing process wherein a sample of 250-500 mg is taken from the item by scrapping, drilling, or cutting. The method may lead to the damage of the article, rendering it unsellable, especially when dealing with a few or single article. However, the gold loss incurred during testing is almost negligible. Additionally, the process emits hazardous substances like lead oxides and nitrous fumes.\n\nFurther, BIS has also formulated an Indian Standard on method of test using ED-XRF (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence), i.e., IS 18458: 2023 \"Jewellery and precious metals ED-XRF test - Method of test\". This Indian Standard prescribes a non-destructive testing method to verify the fineness of the gold jewellery. However, the use of ED-XRF as a non-destructive method to determine the fineness is only applicable to homogenous gold jewellery. In addition, IS 18458: 2023 also has a provision for determination of fineness of jewellery by destructive testing, which is more suited for non-homogeneous jewellery.\n\nThere is another Indian Standard developed by BIS, IS 16901: 2022 \"Jewellery and precious metals determination of high purity gold, platinum and palladium - difference method using ICP-OES\". This method uses ICP-OES and is applicable only for high purity gold (999 ppt and above). ICP-OES is also a destructive testing method.\n\nIndia's gold jewellery industry is highly diverse, encompassing various types such as casted jewellery, handmade pieces with soldered joints, hollow and filled jewellery, gold-plated items, and studded ornaments using various jewellery manufacturing techniques. While casted jewellery is relatively homogeneous, the majority-particularly handmade and hollow varieties-are structurally complex and heterogeneous. This variability presents significant challenges in testing and hallmarking.\n\nIn the existing fire assay testing method, heterogeneity is addressed by melting the sample before testing. This eliminates impurities and ensures homogeneity. Moreover, fire assay being a difference method (based on initial and final weight of gold sample), the impact of heterogeneity is nullified. However, owing to its destructive nature, there is strong demand for an alternative non-destructive testing method.\n\nExpected Solution:\na. Develop and implement a non-destructive assaying method that matches the accuracy of fire assay without damaging the jewellery, while being capable of handling heterogeneous compositions (solders, fillers, non-metallic substances).\nb. Eliminate emissions of harmful substances (lead oxide, nitrous fumes).\nc. Achieve repeatability close to that of fire assay, ideally within ±0.5 ppt (as per IS 1418).\nd. Method selected will be validated for regulatory and commercial applications.\n\nDeliverables:\na. Detailed non-destructive innovative testing method with technical explanation\nb. References/bibliography related to the technical paper\nc. Scientific principles underlying the approach\nd. Feasibility studies and expected challenges\ne. Methodology for validation including accuracy assessment\nf. Explanatory note on potential for regulatory and commercial application"

    description: "Background\n\nIn FY 2021–22, India generated approximately 1.7 lakh tonnes of municipal solid waste daily, of which only 54% was scientifically treated. Around 24% was dumped in landfills and 22% remained unaccounted due to leakages in the waste management chain. This unaccounted waste is often burned or disposed of in open areas, drains, or water bodies, posing severe environmental and public health risks. (CEEW, 2025) This calls for strict solutions to enable all the waste generators to contribute to Waste Management.\n\nDescription\n\nOverview: According to the CPCB’s Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Annual Report for 2021-22, India generates approximately 1,70,339 tonnes of waste per day (TPD). Of this, around 1,56,449 TPD is collected. Out of the collected waste, 91,511 TPD is treated, while 41,455 TPD is disposed of in landfills. This leaves a significant gap of 37,373 TPD in effective waste management.\nWaste treatment: The total waste processed/treated across the country is 91,511 TPD. When compared to the total waste generated, which is 1,70,339 TPD, it is found that an average of 54% of the waste is treated/processed across the country.\nSolid Waste Processing Facilities: A total of 249 Waste-to-Energy plants, 819 Biomass Power plants and 50.8 lakhs small Biogas plants have been set up in the country to generate Power/Biogas/BioCNG.\n\nExpected Solutions\n\nThe proposals aim to develop a strict system to ensure that every citizen is trained on waste management, waste workers get strict training and required safety gear, waste management facilities are present in every ULB/GP, and a dedicated decentralised monitoring system is in place. The solutions are as follows:\n\n1. Mandatory training for every citizen: Similar to countries where military training is mandatory for every citizen, in India, there shall be mandatory Waste Management training for every Waste Generator/Citizen. This will ensure source segregation, which will result in better waste management, lesser load on waste management facilities and landfills.\n  i. Physical training on types of waste, source segregation, how to make compost at home, re-use of plastic, etc.\n  ii. Distribution of 3 types of dustbins for dry, wet and domestic hazardous waste to every household/citizen.\n  iii. Distribution of a designed and tested compost making kit to every household/citizen.\n  iv. App-based monitoring.\n2. Phase-wise training to all Waste Workers\n3. Formation of Area Committee for Monitoring – to be called as “Green Champions”: Decentralised approach for Monitoring has to be done at every step of Waste Management for bulk waste generators, residential areas, commercial & Public semi-public building, Industrial buildings, etc.\n  i. Training of all Waste Generators\n  ii. Waste Generation: Source segregation happening or not, no wet waste to be collected\n  iii. Waste Collection happening on ground level\n  iv. Waste transportation\n  v. Waste treatment\n  vi. Waste Disposal\n4. Incentive based approach: Incentive to Bulk waste generators and other buildings for source segregation.\n5. Waste Movements in ULBs: Taking example from Karnataka’s Yadgir city, “If you see waste, send photo” similar movement to be made mandatory for every ULB regardless of its size and population, to ensure community participation.\n6. Community Participation: One day of all working staff regardless of employment type to be engaged in Cleaning of Public areas, waste management. Inspired from Cleaning-day followed in schools every week, every waste generator to be responsible for keeping the country clean and contributing to waste management, starting from Govt. sector.\n7. Penalization system: Fines to be imposed and no waste collection for buildings not segregating waste at source as punishment.\n8. Waste Management Facilities to be made available in every ULB:\n  i. Biomethanization plant\n  ii. W-to-E plant\n  iii. Multiple Recycling centres for different types of waste\n  iv. Scrap collection shops – Online app based\n9. Complete Digital App-based system for:\n  i. Training of all Waste Generators\n  ii. Shopping of Waste utilities – compost kits, dustbins, etc.\n  iii. Tracking of Waste collection vehicles\n  iv. Location of Waste management facilities, Recycling centres, scrap shops etc.\n  v. Option to upload geo-tagged photos of dumping sites, etc."

Securely submit verified data to SAI servers for further evaluation and athlete profiling.\n4. Be low-cost and lightweight, ensuring accessibility even on entry-level smartphones and low-bandwidth networks.\n\nInnovative Features\n1. **AI-based Cheat Detection:** Identify anomalies or manipulations (e.g., tampered videos or incorrect movements) to ensure fair assessments.\n2. **Offline Video Analysis:** Perform preliminary performance analysis directly on the device without requiring continuous internet connectivity.\n3. **Performance Benchmarking:** Compare athlete performance against age/gender-based benchmarks, providing instant feedback.\n4. **Gamified User Interface:** Use progress badges, leaderboards, and interactive visuals to engage athletes and encourage participation.\n5. **Auto-Test Segmentation:** Automatically detect and segment performance clips (e.g., counting reps in sit-ups or analyzing vertical jumps) to reduce manual effort.\n\nExpected Deliverables\n1. Mobile application (Android/iOS) for video recording and assessment of athletes’ performance.\n2. AI/ML modules for on-device video analysis, verification of test results, and cheat detection.\n3. Secure backend system to transmit data to the Sports Authority of India.\n4. Dashboard for officials to view and evaluate verified performance data.\n\nExpected Impact\n1. Democratization of sports talent assessment, reaching even remote areas.\n2. Low-cost, scalable solution enabling mass participation in talent identification initiatives.\n3. Improved efficiency and transparency in evaluating and discovering potential athletes."
